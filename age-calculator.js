/*Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:

name – a string representing someone's name
yearOfBirth – a number representing their year of birth
currentYear – a number representing the current year
The ageCalculator function should return a string 
explaining how old the person is. For example, if we called 
ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, the return value should be:
"Suzie is 32 years old."
*/

function ageCalculator(name, yearOfBirth, currentYear) {
  return name + " is " + (currentYear - yearOfBirth) + " years old.";
}

console.log(ageCalculator("Miranda", 1983, 2015));
console.log(ageCalculator("Ferdinand", 1988, 2015));
